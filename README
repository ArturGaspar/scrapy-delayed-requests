Scrapy downloader middleware that allows for delaying a request by a
number of seconds.

To use, enable the downloader middleware and set `delay_request` to a
number of seconds in request meta.

Starting with Scrapy 1.0, this functionality can be implemented in a
very simple manner, so this is not an active project. No copyright,
feel free to copy this code into your own project and use it however
you want.

`scrapy_delayed_requests.py` works with Scrapy 1.0 or newer.
`scrapy_delayed_requests_old.py` works with some previous version
Scrapy.
